# LeetCode Practice via NeetCode Coursemap

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress and solutions as I work through the NeetCode coursemap.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures by practicing LeetCode problems. I will be following the NeetCode coursemap, which organizes problems into categories for a structured learning experience.

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific category (e.g., Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees) as outlined by the NeetCode coursemap. Inside each folder, you'll find my solutions to the relevant LeetCode problems.

<!-- ## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired category:
    ```
    cd leetcode-practice/Arrays
    ```
3. Run the Javascript solution:
    ```
    node problem1-solution.js
    ``` -->

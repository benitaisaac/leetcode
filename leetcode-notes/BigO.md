#Big O Notation

## What is Big O?

Big O Notation is a mathematical function used in computer science to describe how complex an algorithm is. It describes the execution time required by an algorithm. This is used to compare the efficiency of different approaches to solve a problem. 

## O(1)

The time doesn't change based on input size.
These are the most effecient algorithms.
